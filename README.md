Rock Paper Scissors Project v2

Part of the Odin Project - Javascript Foundations

I adjusted the original 'Rock Paper Scissors' project to have a html UI and buttons for player input (rather than through the console). I used rudimentary @media css styling to adjust the UI for different screen sizes. I also added a replay button functionality and mouseover effects on the buttons.
